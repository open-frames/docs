# Best Practices

Open Frames is a powerful tool for creating interactive link previews. Below are some best practices to keep in mind when building Open Frames.

## Performance

For the best UX, frames should be fast and snappy. Clients are encouraged to enforce a 5 second timeout, which is something to be aware of as a frames developer.

- Avoid using dynamic images when possible, opting for static ones instead
- For slow APIs like LLMs, we recommend responding with a "loading frame" that has a refresh button rather than waiting for the response.
- Consider the physical location of the servers you're deploying to - we recommend these be in North America for the time being.

## User Interface

Frames should be designed to be user-friendly and accessible. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- Frames are displayed in feeds which are primarily consumed on mobile devices - make sure your text is legible on small screen sizes.
- Prefer buttons over text inputs that require thse user to do external information lookups where possible. This may require you to look up external information about a user based on their identity and given frame context for presentation as a button.

## Security

When taking actions on a user's behalf via frame interactions, be sure to only use trusted data and validate the user's identity to prevent impersonation attacks.
